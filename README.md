## 🤖 Competitive Programming Scores - A Confession and Invitation

The competitive programming section of this portfolio currently requires manual updates for scores from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeChef. This means the scores you see here are static and may not always reflect the latest achievements.

If you are interested in contributing, I warmly invite you to help enhance this section by adding APIs or automation scripts that can fetch and update these scores automatically. Your contributions will make this portfolio more dynamic and up-to-date!

Feel free to open a pull request or reach out if you want to collaborate on this feature.
